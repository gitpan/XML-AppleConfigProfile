This document discusses how the test scripts are laid out.

Test files with a + before their names will not run (or will only partially run)
unless the RELEASE_TESTING environment variable exists, or unless certain
supplemental modules are installed.

Test files with an X before their names haven't been created yet.  They appear
on the list simply as a reminder that they need to be implemented, and that the
particular number has been reserved for them.
