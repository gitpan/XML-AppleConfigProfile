=head1 NAME

XML::AppleConfigProfile::Payload::Types - Data types for payload keys.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Apple Configuration Profiles contain one or more I<payloads>.  Each payload
contains a dictionary, which can be thought of like a Perl hash.  Within a
payload's dictionary, each key's value is restricted to a specific type.
One key might require a number; a different key might require a string, or some
binary data.

Provided in this module are a number of Readonly scalars that will be used
(instead of strings) to identify the data types for configuration profile keys.
The scalars are all OK for import into your local namespace, or you can simply
import C<:all> to get all of them at once. 

=head1 TYPES

Apple Configuration Profile payloads use the following types:

=head2 String (C<$ProfileString>)

A UTF-8 string.  The client should simply provide a Perl string (NOT a binary
string).  Multi-line strings are allowed, although specific payload keys may
not allow this.  Empty strings are B<not> allowed.

B<NOTE:>  If your source data was not ASCII, and not UTF-8, then please make
sure you have converted it before doing anything else!  "converted it" normally
means using C<Encode::decode> to convert from the original encoding.  Your
string will not be valid unless it can be encoded as UTF-8.

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileString => 1;


=head2 Number (C<$ProfileNumber>)

An Integer, which may be positive, zero, or negative.  The plist standard
doesn't specify a range, but one may be imposed by specific keys.

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileNumber => 2;


=head2 Real (C<$ProfileReal>)

A real number, which may be positive, zero, or negative.  It may also have
an exponent.  The plist standard doesn't specify a range, but one may be
imposed by specific keys.

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileReal => 5;


=head2 Data (C<$ProfileData>)

Binary data.

Binary data may be provided by the client in multiple ways.
Clients can provide an open filehandle, or an open C<IO> object.
C<Scalar::Util::openhandle> is used to make sure the handle/object is open.

The file needs to be open for reading.

The client may also provide a string.  If a string is provided, then it must be
a I<non-empty>, I<binary> string.  In other words, C<utf8::is_utf8> needs to
return C<false>.  If the flag is C<true>, then you probably need to use
C<Encode::encode> (or maybe C<Encode::encode_utf8>) to get a binary string.

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileData => 3;


=head2 Boolean (C<$ProfileBool>)

Either True for False.  When reading a boolean from a payload's contents, a 1
is used to represent true, and 0 is returned for false.  When setting a boolean,
the value provided is filtered using the code C<($value) ? 1 : 0>.  As long as
you aren't providing C<undef> as the input, your input will probably be
accepted!

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileBool => 4;


=head2 Date (C<$ProfileDate>)

A date.  This is stored internally as a C<DateTime> object, and when read a
C<DateTime> object will be returned.  When serialized into plist form, the
time will be in UTC, but no other guarantees are made about the timezone when
the object is stored internally, so if you read a Date, be sure to call
C<< ->set_time_zone() >> before outputting it yourself.

If a string is provided, L<DateTime::Format::Flexible> will be used to parse it.
For best results, parse it yourself, and provide the resulting C<DateTime>
object!

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileDate => 5;


=head2 Dictionary (C<$ProfileDict>)

A dictionary is the plist equivalent to a Perl hash, and that is what will be
made available.  The client should expect the hash to restrict what key names,
and what values, are accepted.  For more information, see the
documentation for the specific payload key.

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileDict => 10;


=head2 Array (C<$ProfileArray>)

An array, similar to a Perl array.  The client should expect the array to only
accept certain data types.  For more information, see the documentation for the
specific payload key.

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileArray => 11;


=head2 NSData Blob

This is a weird type.  The only place it appears in the I<Configuration Profile
Reference> (the edition dated 2014-03-20) is in the C<Certificate> key in the
Exchange payload.  I don't really understand this, though I'm guessing it's
really a Data type, and the I<NSData Blob> is referring to the contents.

Until I get more information on what exactly this is, this type will likely go
unimplemnented.  Right now, the same checks are performed as for the
C<Data> type.

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileNSDataBlob => 20;


=head1 CUSTOM TYPES

The following types are not defined in the plist standard, but they are being
treated specially here.

=head2 UUID (C<$ProfileUUID>)

I<Also known as a GUID>

Although the plist format does not have a special type for UUIDs (a simple
String is used), these modules designate a special type for UUIDs as a
convenience to the client.  All payloads have a UUID as one of the required
keys.  If the client does not specify a UUID when creating a payload, then
one will be lazily auto-generated.

If you would like to set an explicit UUID, you may provide a C<Data::UUID>
object, a C<Data::GUID> object, or a string that C<Data::GUID> can parse.  When
reading, a C<Data::GUID> object is returned, but that can be converted into a
string very easily:

    $uuid = "$uuid";

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileUUID => 21;


=head2 Identifier (C<$ProfileIdentifier>)

This is another convenience type.  All payloads require an identifier,
which is a reverse-DNS-style (Java-style) string.  If the client does not
specify an identifier, then one will be lazily auto-generated.

See RFC 1035 for the standard relating to host and domain names, but please note
that spaces are I<not> acceptable here, even though they may be in RFC 1035.

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileIdentifier => 22;


=head2 Class (C<$ProfileClass>)

This profile type is used to indicate that the value is an instance of a class.
The class is a sub-class of C<XML::AppleConfigProfile::Payload::Common>, so the
methods implemented in that class are all available.  More information about
what specific sub-class is used can be found in the documentation for the
specific payload key.

=cut

Readonly our $ProfileClass => 24;
