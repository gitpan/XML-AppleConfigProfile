=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements the Email payload, which is used to configure POP
and IMAP accounts.  For Exchange accounts, refer to
L<XML::AppleConfigProfile::Payload::Exchange::iOS> or
L<XML::AppleConfigProfile::Payload::Exchange::OSX>.

Each email account has basic information, information about how to fetch mail,
information about how to send mail, S/MIME configuration, and interaction.

For fetching mail, either POP or IMAP can be used.  Authentication is with
a password, or it can be turned off.  SMTP is used for sending mail, either
with or without a username and password.  SSL is supported for both sending
and receiving, and is enabled by default.

B<NOTE:> If the server(s) are only accessible on an internal network, you may
want to include a VPN payload as part of the profile, so that the user will
be able to access the server(s) while not on the internal Wi-Fi network.

Passwords can be included in the payload, but then the payload should be
encrypted, or delivered in some secure manner.  If passwords are not specified,
the user will be prompted to enter the password when the profile is installed.

S/MIME can be configured for email signing and decryption.  For S/MIME to work,
a .p12 file (a private key and certificate in a PKCS#12 container, also known
as an "identity certificate") must be on the device.  The identity certificate
can be loaded using L<XML::AppleConfigProfile::Payload::Certificate::PKCS12>,
and may be part of the same profile, or a different profile.  If S/MIME is
enabled but no signing or decrypting certificates are specified in the payload,
the user will be able to choose which identity certificate to use.

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

The following instance methods are provided, or overridden, by this class.

=head2 validate_key($key, $value)

Performs additional validation for certain payload keys in this class:

=over 4

=item * C<EmailAddress>

This must be a properly-formed email address.

=item * C<EmailAccountType>

This must be the string C<EmailTypePOP> or C<EmailTypeIMAP>.

=item * C<IncomingMailServerHostName> and C<OutgoingMailServerHostName>

These must be properly-formed hostnames or IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6).

=item * C<IncomingMailServerPortNumber> and C<OutgoingMailServerPortNumber>

These must be positive numbers less than 65535.

=item * C<IncomingMailServerAuthentication> and
C<OutgoingMailServerAuthentication>

These must be the string C<EmailAuthPassword> or C<EmailAuthNone>.

All other payload keys will be checked as usual by the parent class.

I<Optional>

A string.  This is the account description shown in the Mail and Settings apps.

=head3 C<EmailAccountName>

I<Optional>

The sender's name, shown in outgoing email addresses.

=head3 C<EmailAddress>
