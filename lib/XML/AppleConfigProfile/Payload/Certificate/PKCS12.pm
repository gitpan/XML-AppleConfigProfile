=head1 NAME

XML::AppleConfigProfile::Payload::Certificate::PKCS12 - Bundle containing
one certificate and its matching private key.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use XML::AppleConfigProfile;
    use XML::AppleConfigProfile::Payload::Certificate::PKCS12;
    
    my $cert = new XML::AppleConfigProfile::Payload::Certificate::PKCS12;
    $cert->payload->{PayloadIdentifier} = 'local.acme.key.user10';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadDisplayName} = 'Private key & cert';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadDescription} = 'The private key and certificate for employee #10';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadOrganization} = 'Acme, Inc.';
    $cert->payload->{PayloadCertificateFileName} = 'user10.p12'; 
    $cert->payload->{Password} = 'Monkey123'; # DON'T DO THIS IN REAL LIFE!!!
    $cert->payload->{PayloadContent} = '.................'; # Binary data here
    
    my $profile = new XML::AppleConfigProfile;
    push @{$profile->content}, $cert;
    
    print $profile->export;
    
    
=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class implements the PKCS12 type of Certificate payload.

This payload contains a single certificate, and the certificate's private key,
in a PKCS#12 container.  The container is encrypted with a password.

This payload is used to hold B<only one> certificate.  If you have any
intermediate certificates, you will need to use a second Certificate payload
(either a PEM or a PKCS1) to hold each intermediate certificate.


=head1 PAYLOAD KEYS

All of the payload keys defined in 
L<XML::AppleConfigProfile::Payload::Common::Certificate> are used by this
payload.

This payload has the following additional keys:

=head2 C<Password>

This is the password needed to decrypt the PKCS#12 file.  If no password is
provided, the user will be prompted to enter the password when installing the
profile.

=head2 C<PayloadType>

This is fixed to the string C<com.apple.security.pkcs12>.

=head2 C<PayloadVersion>

This is fixed to the value C<1>.
