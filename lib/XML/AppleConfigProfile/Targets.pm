=head1 NAME

C<XML::AppleConfigProfile::Targets> - Constants for payload targets

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Apple Configuration Profiles can be used on different platforms.  Although some
payloads only work on specific platforms, most payloads can be at least
partially applied to all platforms that support Apple Configuration Profiles.

Provided in this module are a number of Readonly scalars that will be used
(instead of strings) to identify the platforms supported by configuration
profiles.  The scalars are all OK for import into your local namespace, or you
can simply import C<:all> to get all of them at once. 

=head1 TYPES

Apple Configuration Profiles can be targeted to the following platforms:

=head2 C<TargetIOS>

Apple's iOS.  In general, at least iOS version 5.0 is required.

=head2 C<TargetOSX>
